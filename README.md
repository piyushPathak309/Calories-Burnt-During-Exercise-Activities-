# Calories-Burnt-During-Exercise-Activities-

## Problem Satement:
Need to find number of calories burned by a person while performing some activity/exercise.
as running, cycling, calisthenics, etc.

## Objective :
**This dataset contains tabular data for gender, age, height, weight, duration of exercise done, heart beat rate, body temparature, and calories burnt from 15000 samples. Hence it is possible to develop a regression model for calories burnt by using this available data.** Throughout this Project i have followed the whole life cycle of a Data Science Project as: 
### EDA(Exploring Data and Understanding features doing univariate analysis,Bivariate analysis,Finding Distribution) and Data Cleaning(Finding Types of Features,Duplicate values,Missing Values,Outlier Detection)
### Feature Engineering((Imputting Missing Values,Outlier)) and Feature Selection ,Feature Scaling
### Model Selection 
### Model Building 
### Model HyperParameter Tuning
### Model Evaluation(Testing)

## Tools and Technologies Used :
Python,Machine Learning,Sklearn,Pandas,Matplotlib,Seaborn,Numpy,Streamlit,Heroku.

## Data Collection :
I have gathered dataset from Kaggle for this project.

## EDA:
Perform eda on dataset to derive some conclusion and insights which could further in model building.

## Feature Engineering:
Impute Missing values,handle ouliers,removing duplicates values.

## Feature Selection :
Perform feature selection using correlation matrix and tried to know which feature is impacting much to my target variable.

## Model selection :
used various machine learning algorithms(Linear regression,Decision tree regressor,Random forest regressor) and tried to know which best suite on my dataset.

## Model Building: 
i have selected Random forest regressor as my base model to build this project

## Model Tuning :
perform hyperparameter tuning on Decision tree and achieved accuracy 96.4%.

## Model Tesing :
perform model testing on unseen data.

## Model Deployment:
save the model and loaded it Pycharm to delpoy it. for converting into web-app i have used streamlit and then deploy the model on heroku plateform.
